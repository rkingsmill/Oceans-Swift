## Introduction

Part 1 will test your understanding of OOP principals.

The Lighthouse Fishing Company (LFC™) has invented a new form of fishing: Underwater fishing!!! ZOMG!

Without the success of this vessel, The LFC™ will *GO UNDER*!

**Please read this document very carefully before starting.**

## Tip

Read Ocean.h and Ocean.m first and make sure you understand everything in there, especially the BOARD.

## Your Mission

Your goal is the make all the tests pass.

**Steps:**

1. Read the CODE for the test file that you ran
2. Understand what tests it contains and what each test in that file is expecting
3. Start implementing your code to satisify each test
4. Run the test suite using `command + U`
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until all tests pass.

## Marking

Even if you make all the tests pass, you may lose marks for incorrectly implementing the solution (eg: incorrect use of OOP).

This test is created such that there are indeed correct right ways to implement your app, and incorrect ways.

You can also lose marks for bad form. Some Examples of bad form include:
* Improper or confusing naming of variables, methods, etc.
* Improper or confusing formatting
* Overly verbose code that could be implemented much more simply
* Not writing code in the "iOS Way". 

**Note:** Hard coding the behavior of a method to simply make the current tests pass but not actually fulfilling the goal/responsibility of the method will *not* count as a valid solution, warranting no part marks at all.

### Mark Allocation:

01. 10%
02. 10%
03. 10%
04. 10%
05. 20%
07. 15% (Bonus)

## Other Important Notes: 

* Do not modify code in the XCTestCase classes. (except for the Question 7 - Bonus question)
* The tests will require you to create new classes as you progress.
* You are allowed to google around
* Please do not create a public repo nor share your work in any other way with anyone during the test
* The bonus question requires you to write Tests in the XCTestCase_07 class and code in other classes to make that test pass.
* This test is intended to take 2hr to complete
